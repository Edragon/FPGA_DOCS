Quartus II 3.0 
1. Important parameters check for the models.
2. Bug fix for: lpm_divide, lpm_counter, lpm_fifo_dc, lpm_rom. 

QuartusII 2.2

QuartusII 2.0
GENERAL: Support for non-PLI flow for convert_hex2ver in Verilog.
LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_ROM: Read correctly values from LPM_FILE (*.hex) when DATA width is greater than
16 bits.

QuartusII 1.1
LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_ROM: Fixed SPR 82832, inapporiate use of blocking assignments.
LPM_RAM_DQ: Fixed SPR82832, race condition in LPM_RAM_DQ with VerilogXL.
LPM_RAM_IO: Fixed SPR82096, the memenab and outenab signals are not initialized.
LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_DQ: Adding USE_EAB=ON suppport.
LPM_FIFO_DC: Make DCFIFO and LPM_FIFO_DC models consistent.

QuartusII 1.0
LPM_FIFO_DC: Fixed SPR78303, remove use of blocking assignments.
LPM_RAM_DP: Changed rdclken, and wrclken to connect to pull up properly.

Quartus 2.2
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed to remove requirement to use '-explicit' option in modelsim.
LPM_ROM, LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_IO: Fixed hex reading to support width>32 bits.

Quartus 2.1
LPM_SHIFTREG: Fixed to perform left shift or right shift according to LPM_DIRECTION value.
LPM_SHIFTREG: Change q port to be initialized with 0's.
LPM_SHIFTREG: Added validity check for LPM_DIRECTION value of LPM_SHIFTREG.
LPM_SHIFTREG: Changed shiftout port LPM_SHIFTREG to output LSB of q when LPM_DIRECTION is 'RIGHT'.
LPM_CLSHIFT: Fixed to correctly sign extend output.
LPM_CLSHIFT: Corrected overflow and underflow ports.
LPM_ROM: Check for null init file name.
LPM_LATCH: Changed data port to be initialized with 0's.
LPM_CLSHIFT, LPM_MULT: Fixed array sizes mismatch error.
LPM_FF: Fixed initial state of output.

Quartus 2.0
LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_ROM: Fixed to correctly read in values from LPM_FILE (*.hex) when the data width is
greater than 16 bits.
LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_ROM: Explicit sign conversions are added to standard logic vector comparisons in
VHDL.

Quartus 1.9
LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_IO: Fixed UNUSED file not found problem and initialization problem in VHDL.
LPM_MULT: Fixed when sum port is not used in VHDL.
LPM_FIFO_DC: Fixed to enable read when rdclock and wrclock rise at the same time.
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed comparison problem when signed library is loaded and counter is incrementing.
LPM_COUNTER: Got rid of 'Illegal Character' error message at time=0ns when stimulating.

Quartus 1.8
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed to count correctly without conversion overflow, that is, when LPM_MODULUS = 2**LPM_WIDTH in VHDL.

Quartus 1.7
LPM_RAM_IO: Changed so that it can be used to stimulate both MP2 and Quartus behaviour and LPM220-compliant behaviour.

Quartus 1.6
LPM_FIFO_DC: Changed the behaviour to match that of Quartus.
LPM_LATCH: Changed data port to be initialized with 0.
LPM_COUNTER, LPM_FF, LPM_SHIFTREG: Fixed to output correctly after aclr goes low but before any clock edge, and to output Xs
when both aclr and aset are high.
LPM_FF, LPM_SHIFTREG: Changed q port to be initialized with 0.
LPM_CLSHIFT: Fixed underflow and overflow port in ROTATE mode.
LPM_DIVIDE: Added LPM_REMAINERPOSITIVE parameter. This is a non-LPM 220 standard parameter. It defaults to TRUE for LPM 220
behaviour.
LPM_MULT: Fixed to output correctly.
LPM_ADD_SUB: Changed default value of CIN port when substract.
LPM_ADD_SUB: Changed output pipelines to be initialized with 0's.
LPM_ADD_SUB: Fixed overflow port for signed inputs.
LPM_COUNTER, LPM_FF: Added data port to the sensitivity list. Synthesis tools do not allow mixing of level and edge 
sensitive signals, and hence data port was omitted from the list.
LPM_COUNTER: Corrected the interpretation of CIN port.
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed cout port to go high when count is all 1's.
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed to use LPM_MODULUS.
LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_IO: Fixed to write data at rising clock edge and to output correctly.

Quartus 1.59
GENERAL: Updated comments in header about synthesis issues.
LPM_FIFO_DC: Corrected rdempty flag.
LPM_COUNTER: Fixed error detection of LPM_DIRECTION and UPDOWN conflict.
LPM_ROM: Changed to have no default name for initialization file.

Quartus 1.5
LPM_ADD_SUB, LPM_MULT: Modified to accomodate LPM_WIDTH=1. Default values for LPM_WIDTH is changed back to 1.
LPM_DIVIDE: Added LPM_HINT.
LPM_FIFO_DC: Rewritten to output correctly.
LPM_FIFO: Modified to output 0s before first read, output correct values after aclr and sclr, and output LPM_NUMWORDS mod 
exp(2, LPM_WIDTHU) when FIFO is full.
LPM_COUNTER: Changed LPM_MODULUS from string type to integer.

Quartus 1.4.1
LPM_ADD_SUB, LPM_MULT: Default value of LPM_WIDTH* is changed from 1 to 2.

Quartus 1.4
GENERAL: Added default values for each optional input.
GENERAL: Some LPM_PVALUE implementations were missing, and now implemented.
LPM_MUX, LPM_DECODE, LPM_ADD_SUB, LPM_MULT, LPM_COMPARE: Added clken port.

Quartus 1.3
GENERAL: Changed default value to 'UNUSED' for LPM_SVALUE, LPM_AVALUE, LPM_MODULUS and LPM_NUMWORDS, LPM_HINT, LPM_STRENGTH,
LPM_DIRECTION and LPM_PVALUE in VHDL.
LPM_AND, LPM_OR, LPM_XOR, LPM_MUX: Added two dimentional port components in VHDL.
LPM_FIFO, LPM_FIFO_DC: Corrected cout and empty/full flags.
LPM_COUNTER: Implemented cin/cout.
LPM_MODULUS: It's now working.

Quartus 1.2
GENERAL: Parameters and ports are added/discarded according to the spec.
LPM_RAM_DP, LPM_RAM_DQ, LPM_RAM_IO, LPM_ROM, LPM_FIFO, LPM_FIFO_DC: Added new functions.

Quartus 1.1
LPM_DIVIDE: Added new function.

Quartus 1.0
LPM_FSM, LPM_TTABLE: Excludes these functions.
